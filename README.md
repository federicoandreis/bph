# BPH-Scotland 

Benign Prostate Hyperplasia drugs prescription trends in Scotland

Author: Federico Andreis
Co-authors: Ashleigh Ward, Emanuele Giorgi

This repository is intended for storing and sharing code and analysis results on our attempt to describe spatio-temporal trends in BPH-related drugs prescriptions. The initial dataset refers to gp-level data in Scotland, and is publically available [note to self: there seems to be some additional (and more recent) information on the website - https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/prescriptions-in-the-community - check with Ashleigh].
